# RAG-Document-Referencing

## Problem Statement - 
We assume that there are multiple manuals / policy documents and each document has various sections. Often time various sections or subsections are referred from other sections for detailed information within same document or in a different document.

Design a system so that based on user's question, system should use all relevant documents and sections to provide a comprehensive answer. The code uses dummy tools and dummy documents, and simplifies a lot of things for illustration.
